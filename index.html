        <p> chgwp.py is a Python script to change the wallpapers for all
        monitors on a given virtual desktop in OS X based on a supplied "theme"
        keyword (or randomly, if no keyword was supplied). Read more and
        download here:
        <a href="http://bcwolven.github.io/pychgwp">chgwp.py</a>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This script relies on the availablility of the
        following modules that come with the "stock" OS X Python: 
        <pre><code>
        from AppKit import NSWorkspace, NSScreen
        from Foundation import NSURL
        </pre></code>
        </p>
        <p>Now *my* default version of Python is *not* the standard OS version,
        but you can specify which version of Python is called in various ways.
        To use this script I simply make it executable and include the
        following as the first line:
        <pre><code>
        #!/usr/bin/python
        </pre></code>
        </p>
        <p>You can point to a different version of Python, say that installed
        using <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>, by changing that first
        line to the following, e.g., if you've installed a particular package
        using brew and don't <em>want</em> to use the standard OS version of
        Python.
        <pre><code>
        #!/usr/local/bin/python
        </pre></code>
